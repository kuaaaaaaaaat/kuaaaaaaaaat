My first code for the console game "Sea Battle" is written in C, developed by a group of 3 people, and with the help of a teacher.

#include <stdio.h> // I/O header file
#include <stdlib.h> // Header file of the C standard library, which contains functions, memory, program execution, type conversion.
#include <string.h> // Header file of the C standard library containing functions for working with strings ending in 0 and various memory functions
#include <ctype.h> // Header file of the C programming language standard library containing function declarations for classifying and converting individual characters
#include <time.h> // Header file of the C programming language standard library containing types and functions for working with date and time.

// Macros for the number of rows and columns on the playing field
#define rows 10
#define cols 10

// Function for displaying the playing field
void print_field(char field[rows][cols]) {
printf(" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\ n"); // Column header
    printf(" ----------------------\ n"); // Dividing line

// Output of lines of the playing field
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
printf("%c |", 'A' + i); // Print the letter of the string
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
printf("%c ", field[i][j]); // Printing the symbol of the game cell
        }
printf("|\n"); // End of line
    }
printf(" ----------------------\ n"); // Dividing line
}

// The main function of the program
int main() {
char player_field[rows][cols]; // The playing field for the player
